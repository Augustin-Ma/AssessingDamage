# Assessing building damage after a seismic event

## Context
This work explores how to assess building damage after the 2023 seismic event in Turkey. 

The first part focus on constructing a reliable dataset of Destroyed and Non-destroyed building footprints by reviewing CEMS rapid mapping products through visual analysis of VHR optical imagery, and ancillary data such as OSM footprints. From those 750 footprints, a buffer of 20m is shaped around to take in account co-registration of Sentinel-1 images, possible offsets or double bounce effects in urban areas. 

Using Sentinel-1 imagery, a time series of the mean backscatter intensity within the footprint of each destroyed building is evaluated to assess the change of trend after event. 

Then, an unsupervised multitemporal change detection method is used to assess changes across the time series: polarimetric SAR data are represented by complex variance-covariance matrices, whose homogeneity is evaluated through a factorization of multiple independent likelihood ratio tests in the time series. To determine where and when a change has occurred in our time series, we implemented a sequential omnibus tests algorithm assessing the overall differences between distributions at multiple times. We obtain temporal change maps that allow to represent the timeline of occurrences of change.

## Description
This repository hosts the materials and workflow prepared for the masterâ€™s thesis available here [Thesis_unsupervised_CD_SAR.pdf](https://github.com/Augustin-Ma/AssessingDamage/blob/c4b3684e43d7ef0a3073fcd298918a7df92f28cc/Thesis_unsupervised_CD_SAR.pdf). 

The process is developed on Google Earth Engine via Colaboratory Notebook, which online version is available here https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f4f8smWhSSeURFhs04Qw5z7bDVZf5dJO?usp=sharing.

The outputs of our analysis are displayed via an interactive HQ Observable tool available here https://observablehq.com/@ulgeovisualization/damage-assessment-using-sar, offering insights into the strengths and limits of the approach at the building level accross various parameters. HQ Observable is a collaborative data visualization and analysis platform using JavaScript. It allows to share data inractively with dynamic visualizations and computational notebooks.

## Framework
The overall methodological framework is described in the following schema:
