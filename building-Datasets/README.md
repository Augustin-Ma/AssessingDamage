# Assessing building damage after a seismic event
# Visual interpretation

## Method
From the review of the CEMS building assessment, we produced a reliable dataset of Destroyed and Non-Desttroyed building footprints (section 5.1.1). Visual analysis was performed using VHR optical images before and after event, as well as ancillary information such as OSM footprints and Google street view. We obtained a total of 375 buildings footprints classified as ’Destroyed’ with a ’High’ level of confidence. We also randomly selected an equal number of ’Non-destroyed’ buildings for each Area of Interest (AOI), in order to compare the analyses of both damaged and non-damaged surfaces. From those 750 footprints, a buffer of 20m is appplied to account for the co-registration of Sentinel-1 images, possible offsets or double bounce effects in urban areas.
